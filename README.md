* **Data Storage Architecture**: Raw data is stored separately from the user-facing tables (edit forms) in a hidden worksheet. When the workbook is saved, only this hidden sheet is written to disk, without column headers. As a result, if the file is opened independently—without the Utter Inventory Add-In—only raw row data is visible, without any associated forms or metadata. When the **“Create Template”** button is executed, all necessary forms are dynamically generated, data is mapped back from the corresponding columns, and the raw data sheet is re-hidden. This approach allows users to securely manage their data while maintaining a clean and convenient reporting interface.

* **Barcode and QR Code Generation (Planned)**: Future development includes integrating open-source libraries to support the generation of both barcodes and QR codes for each table row, enabling automated item labeling and streamlined scanning workflows.

* **Scanner Input (Planned)**: Additional planned functionality includes direct data input via USB-connected barcode scanners, as well as QR code recognition through a standard webcam or dedicated scanning devices.
